This course is part of the FinTech for finance and business leaders professional certificate program. This course will provide a view of what lies under the surface of a machine learning output, help to better interrogate a model, and partner with data scientists and others in an organisation to drive adoption and use of machine learning. Digital finance knowledge and skills are essential components of the technology transformation as business becomes increasingly customer focused. And having the skills to understand how these technologies are deployed and integrated into a customer centric business strategy is essential. With 16 Jupyter Notebooks available, alongside corresponding solution notebooks, and bonus exercises you will quickly become skilled in specific time-saving Machine Learning tools\\n    What You Will Learn: An introduction to Python starting from initial setup and explaining foundational concepts like data types, variables, mathematical operators, flow control, and functions. Using Python for data analysis including how to load data from different sources, drill down and segment, create pivot table style aggregations and explore data visualisation libraries.. Automating Excel workflows using Python to write macros that can be run at the click of a button using the full power of the Python eco-system; and to create template reports that update live with the latest data.. How to better interrogate a model, and partner with data scientists and others in an organisation to drive adoption and use of Machine Learning.
